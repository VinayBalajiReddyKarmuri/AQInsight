SMARTERSKIES

📖 About the Project

Smarter Skies was our very first step into building a real-world web application. We wanted to create something useful and impactful, so we decided to work on Air Quality Index (AQI) Monitoring & Prediction.

This project combines real-time AQI data visualization, pollutant analysis, and even future AQI prediction using machine learning. Our goal was simple:
👉 Help people understand the air quality around them in an easy-to-use and visually appealing way.

We built this in 2023, and it remains a special milestone as our first complete end-to-end project.
